    Fix error when entering findpics multiple times during program run  FINISHED
        This was caused by not resetting the im_id index to 0 when
        reforming the list. It would occur in situations where you find
        pics then go through the list, then find pics again and the 
        new list of pics isn't as long as the old list, so the im_id
        is set to an index that doesn't exist. Fixed by setting im_id 
        to 0 upon creation of a new list.
